  comment = {The number of tags expected to map to a gene is not only dependent
	on the expression level and length of the gene, but also the composition
	of the RNA population that is being sampled...we cannot always expect
	the proportions of different experiment conditions (e.g;, tissues)
	to be directly comparable! Proportion of reads attributed to a given
	gene in a library depends on the expression properties of the whold
	sample rather than just the expression level of that gene. Also can
	use estimated normalization factors directly in a statistical model
	while preserving sampling properties of the data. LOTS of informative
	code/data available on website. TMM Normalization.},
